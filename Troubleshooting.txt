1. Linker error: unresolved external symbol BT::Parser::Parser or HTN::Parser::Parser:
Author of Behavior Tree and HTN samples in FRAIL used same file name for parser classes of both techniques.
Default Visual Studio project settings put all object (.obj) files in same directory, so one of the files is overriden.
Existing configurations in project files should handle this properly, but make sure that your current configuration
has property "Object File Name" (project properties -> C/C++ -> Output Files) set to "$(IntDir)/%(RelativeDir)/"
