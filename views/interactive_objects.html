Exploding barrel.</h4><p>Exploding barrel is a variation of conventional, metal barrel, which stores flammable liquid of type A. Thanks to its properties, exploding barrel can (and should) be used as a weapon - note that it's perfectly suited for traps. Explosive barrels come in variations with different radiuses: 2, 4 or 8 meters. When exploded, barrels inflict fire damage ranging from 5 to 15 points of life.</p><p>Exploding barrels uses following presets: <code>barrel_e_r4</code>, <code>barrel_e_r2</code> or <code>barrel_e_r8</code>. Each of this presets indicates specific barrel with different radius. They implement <code>barrel_a.lua</code> script, responsible for spawning ribbons for barrels (these, in turn, indicate radius of a spawned barrel), deleting said ribbons when a barrel explodes and dealing damage to all actors within its radius.</p><h4>2.
