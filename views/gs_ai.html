First look</b></h4><p>After unpacking downloaded package or cloning repository (<a href="downloads.html">sources here</a>), following directory structure can be found:</p><pre>
            /
              /build  - working directory of FRAIL
              /src    - source directory for code and assets
              /doc    - documentation
              /tools  - useful tools for modifying FRAIL assets</pre><h4 id="2"><b>2. Running simulation</b></h4><p>FRAIL can be executed by using FRAIL Launcher in <code>build/</code> directory - one can run it by double clicking <code>build/launcher.exe</code> file. When opened, launcher allows user to choose deesired map for the simulation map and/or choose whether one wishes to start the simulation with additional options: freelok (where camera starts from the third person view) and no shadows - with disabled object shadows</p><p>Alternatively, FRAIL can be run with simple command line scripts, also placed in <code>build/</code> directory. When starting FRAIL with scripts, map to be started has to be selected by passing its name through <code>-level</code> parameter. For example, running map <code>arena_a</code> can be achieved with following command executed inside <code>build/</code> directory: <code>run_args.cmd -level arena_a</code></p><p>After starting FRAIL either way, user is asked for basic rendering parameters. One can change desired resolution, change mode to fullscreen, or disable antialiasing. Default values should be OK.</p><p><b>Remark: be sure to set "Floating-point mode:" option to "Consistent", if it has any other value. Simulation can run only with that setting.</b></p><p>Accepting selected rendering settings closes prompt window and starts simulation on selected level.</p><h4 id="3"><b>3. Controlling simulation</b></h4><p>User controls actor in simulation world, called Player. Player has the same capabilities as AI actors - it can walk, run, jump and perform both melee and ranged attacks.</p><p>Controls scheme for player are as follows:</p><pre>
           - mouse movement - change looking direction; Player is observed through third person (TPP) camera
           - left mouse button click - melee attack
           - right mouse button click - ranged attack in direction pointed by camera
           - W - move forward (with respect to camera orientation)
           - A - move left (with respect to camera orientation)
           - S - move back (with respect to camera orientation)
           - D - move right (with respect to camera orientation)
           - space - jump
           - shift - sprint (use with WSAD)</pre><p>One can also switch camera to 'freelook' mode, where camera isn't attached to player, and can move anywhere in the scene (player is constrained by collision and physics). Switching to freelook mode is done with <b>F2</b> key, returning to attached camera - with <b>F3</b>.</p>Other features of simulation control:<pre>
           - freeze simulation time - F9
           - unfreeze simulation time - F10
           - simulation speedup (10x) - F11
           - simulation speedup off - F12
           - show physics debug view - F5
           - hide physics debug view - Ctrl+F5
           - exit - Esc</pre><h4 id="4"><b>4. Modifying simulation data</b></h4><p>FRAIL enables simulation customization on following areas:</p><p>- scripting in Lua</p><p>- adding and modifying objects on levels by modifying simple JSON files or by sing specialized Blender plugin</p><p>- modifying AI behavior by creating new or changing existing actor controllers</p><p>Last area requires writing code, and is covered in part <b>6 - Creating custom AI behavior</b>.</p><h4>4.1 Lua Scripting</h4><p>Most of "game-specific" behaviors of interactive objects in FRAIL are written in Lua scripts, and therefore easily moddable. FRAIL offers simple scripting environment, where each simulated object has its own scripting context, where functions and variables can be defined.</p><p>By defining functions with specific names (later called "Script Handlers"), one can change behavior of game object. Script Handlers are called from native FRAIL code when some event happens, eg. when new frame is started, or object is created.</p><p>Here follows list of available Script Handler types:</p><p>- <code>onPostCreate</code> - called once for object lifetime, after object is created</p><p>- <code>onDestroy</code> - called once for object lifetime, just before object is destroyed; please note object can be destroyed by using DestroyObject function, or by simply unloading the level (and that happens when simulation ends)</p><p>- <code>onUpdate</code> - called once per frame for every object; time intervals between every call vary, and can be obtained with GetTimeDelta function</p><p>- <code>onTakeDamage</code> - called when scripted game object takes damage from any object</p><p>- <code>onTouched</code> - called for objects of class VolumeTrigger (and subclasses), when other game object is inside its volume</p><p>- <code>onExploded</code> - called when object of class ExplodingObject explodes</p><p>Scripts used by FRAIL can be found in <code>build/data/scripts</code> directory.</p><h4>4.2 Modifying levels</h4><p>Levels description can be found in <code>build/data/levels</code> directory. Each level is defined in single .json file. Level format is simple - it's just collection of "game objects" - objects of classes implemented in FRAIL. For example, file:</p><pre>
          {
            "StaticCollidableMesh" :
              {
                "m_meshName" : "arena_a.mesh"
              },
  
            "PlayerSpawner" :
              {
                "m_worldSpawnPos" : { 20.0, 2.0, 32.0 }
              },

            "AISpawner" :
              {
                "m_spawnOrigin" : { -30.0, 2.0, -20.0 },
                "m_spawnRadius" : 1.0,
                "m_aiNum" : 1,
                "m_presetName" : "AISandboxBoss"
              },
  
            "CylinderVolumeTrigger" :
              {
                "Preset" : "lava_lake_r4",
                "Name" : "lava_mid_lava_1",
                "m_worldTransform.position" : { -4.0, 0.0, 4.0 }
              }
          }</pre><p>Defines level with 3 game objects - one of class <code>"StaticCollidableMesh"</code>, which is used for collision tests and rendering, another of class <code>"PlayerSpawner"</code>, which is responsible for creating ("spawning") Player in specified position, and another of class <code>"AISpawner"</code>, responsible for creating <code>m_aiNum=1</code> AIs of preset <code>m_presetName=AISandboxBoss</code> in random places within radius <code>m_spawnRadius=1</code> meters around <code>m_spawnOrigin</code>.</p><p>Last object also defines its name - <code>"lava_mid_lava_1"</code> (objects can be referenced in Lua scripts by their names), and preset - <code>"lava_lake_r4"</code>. Presets define default values for class fields - they're stored in <code>data/presets</code> directory, in JSON files, one per class. Preset files are similar to level files.</p><p>New game object can be added by simply adding new entry to level file.</p><h4 id="5"><b>5. Compiling source code</b></h4><p>Source code can be found in <code>src/code/mkd/</code> directory. Visual C++ 2008 or higher is required to build FRAIL from source. To do that, one must:</p><p>- provide boost headers and compiled libraries; boost is not used in FRAIL source, but is required by OGRE rendering engine; instructions and download can be found at <a href="http://www.boost.org/">the official Boost website</a></p><p>- open FRAIL solution - <code>src/code/mkd/mkd.vcproj</code></p><p>- add boost headers and libraries to project or environment paths <i>(Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories)</i></p><p>- build <i>mkd</i> project</p><p>Besides boost, all other dependencies are included in package. FRAIL uses <b>OGRE</b>, <b>bullet</b>, <b>vjson</b> and <b>LuaJIT</b>.</p><h4 id="6"><strong>6. Creating custom AI behavior</strong></h4><p>Class responsible for simulating AI-controlled actor is <code>ActorAI</code>. It exposes simple interface through which one can control it, with no boilerplate code needed.</p><p>To control <code>ActorAI</code>, one has to create its own <code>ActorController</code> - a class inheriting from <code>ActorController</code> interface. For real usage, see <code>TestActorController</code> and <code>StateMachineActorController</code>.<br><h5><strong>Steps:</strong></h5><ol><li>Create your controller class in new files <b>(it is important that your class name ends with "ActorController")</b></li><li>Inherit it from <code>IActorController</code> and override pure virtual methods</li><li>Include your class header file in <code>src/code/mkd/ActorControllerFactory.cpp</code></li><li>Add new entry for your controller in <code>ActorControllerFactory::create</code> - if your class name is <code>MyTestActorController</code>, your entry should be <code>CREATE_CONTROLLER(MyTest)</code></li></ol><h4>6.1 Nota bene</h4><ol><li>Actor can be controlled by only one controller at a time</li><li>Controller class headers should not be included anywhere outside ActorControllerFactory</li><li>Controllers shouldn't be istantiated explicitly, just use factory</li><li>When adding new compilation unit (.cpp file) it is required to include "pch.h" before anything else</li><li>Controllers are not <code>GameObjects</code>, and do not use <code>FRAIL RTTI</code> - so they cannot be created on level and do not use presets</li></ol></p></div></div></div><!--sidebar --><div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3 sidebar-offcanvas sidebar-nav" id="sidebar" role="navigation"><div class="list-group"><a href="#/gs_ai/#1" class="list-group-item">First look</a> <a href="#/gs_ai/#2" class="list-group-item">Running simulation</a> <a href="#/gs_ai/#3" class="list-group-item">Controlling simulation</a> <a href="#/gs_ai/#4" class="list-group-item">Modifying simulation data</a> <a href="#/gs_ai/#5" class="list-group-item">Compiling source code</a> <a href="#/gs_ai/#6" class="list-group-item">Creating custom AI behavior</a></div></div><!-- /sidebar --></div></div>
