Then, decision was made to continue expanding it as an finishing project for bachelor of sciences degree. At this point, they were joined by Sebastian Łasisz and Miłosz Mazur. A project's supervisor was dr inż. Paweł Myszkowski.</p><p>Today, we aim to continue expanding FRAIL as a complex research tool, to deliver more options, more space, and to provide excellent-working and no less looking content. To boldly go where no AI environment has gone before.</p><h3>What you get</h3><p>Our application was originally made for writing you own controllers and testing them in provided environment (like a 'game' of sorts) - to learn how, <a href="#/gs_ai">head to our quick start guide</a>, but no one will stop you from playing around with built-in controllers first! We've included some pretty simple and popular solutions for you to observe, test and - ultimately - to base your own controllers on.</p><p>The package you download provides you with 3 basic options:</p><ul><li>Launch FRAIL and enjoy built-in map scenarios</li><li>Modify supported maps with our Blender plugin (requires <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender's Foundation Blender</a>) - <a href="#/gs_blender">click here to learn how</a></li><li>Write you own AI controller compatibile with FRAIL framework and test it in our environment (requires code compilation)</li></ul><h3>Licence</h3><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.</div></div></div></div>
