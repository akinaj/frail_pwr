Requirements & Preparations</h2><p>First, make sure that you have appropriate Blender version installed. Due to frequent API changes, our plugin is only guaranteed to work on <b>Blender's Foundation Blender 2.68</b></p><p>Then, you should copy blender plugin script into your installation's <code>addons</code> directory (by default, it's in <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.68\scripts\addons</code>). Go ahead and copy the <code>FRAIL_IMPORT</code> directory.</p><p>The result should look somewhat like this (depending on different plugins you may have installed before):</p><img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderaddons.png"><p>You're all set!</p><p>If all went well, it's time to open Blender. Skip the opening panel and go straight into User preferences pane. You should be presented with view like this:</p><img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderuserpreferences.png" width="100%"><p>Type "frail" into the search box and check the only option into "activated" mode.</p><img src="images/tut_blender/blenderactivated.png" width="100%"><h2 id="2">2. Importing a map</h2><p>Now, locate "Info" section in one of the panels (Blender's layout may be confusing when you see it for the first time, yeah) and choose <code>File -> Import -> FRAIL map file (.json)</code></p><img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderimport.png" width="50%"><p>Next, navigate to <code>mod_levels</code> directory (<code>frail_pwr\build\data\mod_levels</code>) and choose map desired for moding. Import it!</p><p><strong>Caution: it will take... some time. Lots of time, actually, especially with arena_a. Just wait patiently. You may open developer console (<code>Window -> Toggle system console</code>) if you want to stay informed of what's going on in the background.</strong></p><p>When the map finishes importing you're all set! Well, almost.</p><img src="images/tut_blender/blendermapa.png" width="100%"><p>Press <b>N</b> and in "Display" section check the "Textured Solid" option</p><p>You're all set!</p><img src="images/tut_blender/blendermapb.png" width="100%"><h2 id="3">3. Playing around</h2><p>For the time being, you are only permitted to <b>repositioning</b> and <b>deleting</b> object from map. Sorry! Upgrade is on the way.</p><p>Try it out yourself! Move that pesky lava lake to a middle of the map, set the perfect trap for Boss, or align a chain of barrels to trap actors in a sea of fire and crowd control. You don't need snares? Remove them alogether!</p><img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blendermapmod.png" width="100%"><h2 id="4">4. Saving changes</h2><p>When you're done, proceed to <code>File -> Export -> FRAIL map file (.json)</code></p><img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderexport.png" width="50%"><p>Navigate do <code>levels</code> directory (sic!). You'll find it in <code>frail_pwr/build/data/levels</code>. Save under desired name. Note that plugin will automatically add a "_mod" suffix to your choosen name</p><img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderexportout.png" width="100%"><p>Click "Export FRAIL .json map file", and you're all set!</p><h2 id="5">5. Nota bene</h2><p>1. Don't try to import another map directly after exporing current one. Blender has... issues with removing meshes.</p><p>2. When in doubt, don't be afraid to take a look in the developer console <code>Window -> Toggle system console</code> to learn what went wrong</p><p>3. While adding is not yet supported, .obj files for all game objects are available in <code>frail_pwr/build/data/mod_levels/game_objects</code>. You may try importing one manually to set its location wherever you please, and manually modyfying .json map file later, adding a fitting entry.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3 sidebar-offcanvas sidebar-nav" id="sidebar" role="navigation"><div class="list-group"><a href="#/gs_blender/#1" class="list-group-item">1.
