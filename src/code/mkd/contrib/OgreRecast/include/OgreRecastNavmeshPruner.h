 * Tool to flood-fill the navmesh polygons starting at a specific polygon and marking
 * all reachable neighbours. This allows to prune off unreachable parts of the navmesh.
 *
 * Based on NavMeshPruneTool from the original recast sample.
 * The navmesh prune tool allows to disable unreachable polygons. There is currently no
 * way to discard the disabled polys, because the search is done on the final navmesh
 * data (when it is already rasterized) and it is really hard to modify.
